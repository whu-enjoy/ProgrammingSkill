cription
There is a billiard table with acute triangle shape, and there are pockets at the three corners. A billiard ball hits the side of the table not at a 
corner, it is reflected in the mirror direction. And it continues to travel on the table and we assume that the energy of this ball will not be 
consumed, so the velocity of the ball is a constant number in the running process. 
 
Now, you place the ball on any side of this billiard table and decide the slope of the line along which the ball starts at the origin. The trajectory 
of the ball seems too complex to you, right? In order to simply this question, we will set restriction that the ball should bounce each side exactly 
once and return to its start position at last. Under this restriction, can you find such trajectory that the time of ball running along it is shorter 
than any other trajectories which satisfy this restriction? 

Input
There are N test cases. The number of test cases N is given in the first line of the input file. For each test case, it contains six 
integers (you are ensured that the absolute value of all the integers are less than) which specify the vertex point coordinates of the 
acute triangle.
Output
You should output the length of the shortest trajectory.The answer should be accurate to three fractional digits exactly one line for each test case.
