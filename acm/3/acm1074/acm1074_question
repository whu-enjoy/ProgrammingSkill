Description
Given an array consists of n positive integers,your task is to find the largest C which makes C=A+B. A,B,C are all in the given array.
Input
   Standard input will contain multiple test cases. The first line of the input is an integer T (1 <= T <= 20) which is the number of test cases. 
      For each test case,there is an integer n (3<=n<=10000) in the first line,indicating the number of elements in the array.The next line contains
	  n positive integers.You can assume all the integers will be less then 10^9.
	  Output
	     For each test case,if you can find the largest integer C=A+B, output C. Notice, A and B should be different elements in the array.If there isn't
		 such integer C,output -1 instead.
