Description
Some beads are embedded in a bracelet, and each beads is carved with a lower case letter, as the follow figure shows: 
 
If we read the letters in counter clockwise with different initial position, we may get different strings. The above example, we can read 6 strings: 
acabdb 
cabdba 
abdbac 
bdbaca 
dbacab 
bacabd 
Sort these strings in lexical order, we obtain: 
abdbac 
acabdb 
bacabd 
bdbaca 
cabdba 
dbacab 
What we need is the first string: abdbac. 

Input

The length of the string is no more than 100.
