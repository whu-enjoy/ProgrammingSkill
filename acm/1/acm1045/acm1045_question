For example, in sentence "flymouse is poor in EnGlish but his girlfriend is good at English" are there two mistakes:

  1. Initial letter f of the first word flymouse of this sentence is not a capital letter.

    2. EnGlish's medial letter G is a capital letter.

	Notice this, you can correct the mistake by the following two steps:

	  1. Make the initial letter of the first word of the sentence to be capital.

	    2. Make the non-initial letters of the non-first words of the sentence to be small.

		You can assure that by doing this, the new sentence will be always a correct one.

		Flymouse is poor in English but his girlfriend is good at English
