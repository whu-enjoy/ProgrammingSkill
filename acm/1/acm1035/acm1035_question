Description
Magicpig and Acm like to compete with each other recently, and the loser has to "BG" the winner, that means, if Magicpig wins, Acm will treat him to a meal. But Acm is so powerful that Magicpig has to "BG" him almost every time. Everybody is very interested in this. So more and more ACMers are attracted to participate in this game.

One day, Peipei said: "It is unfair that one person should 'BG' all the others. I suggest that 50% of the participants should pay the bill. That means, if there are n participants, then Ceil(n/2) person should 'BG' the other n-Ceil(n/2) person." This is a good idea! So all of us agree to do so. This is the story of "BG".

Now you task is: given a number n -- the total number of participants, you have to calculate how many people should pay the bill.

Input
The input consists of one or more lines.
Each line contains a positive integer n (2 <= n <= 100).
A line which contains a single 0 will end the input, and should not be processed.
Output
A positive integer on each line denoting the required answer.
Sample Input
2
5
10
13
0
Sample Output
1
3
5
7
Hint
注意：

0. ceil是math.h中的函数，用于对浮点数向上取整，返回值也是浮点类型(不是整型)，其原型为：

    double ceil (double x); 

	1. 题目要求能够处理多组数据，应当使用一个循环来完成多组数据的处理；

	2. 题目要求每组输入数据输出一行，因此每次输出后面都要跟一个回车；

	3. 系统能够区分输入和输出，处理一组输出一组即可，不需要收集所有数据一次性输出

	代码框架示例如下：

	int n;

	while (1)

{

	    scanf("%d", &n);

		    if (n == 0) //输入结束标志，n=0时不需要被处理

				        break;

			    int ans = ........; //这里计算得到结果

				    printf("%d\n", ans); //需要加上 \n ，每组处理完直接输出即可。

}
